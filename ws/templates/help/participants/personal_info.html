  <h4>Why do you need my personal information?</h4>
  <p>We will occasionally share your name, email address, and car description with other participants for trip-planning purposes.</p>
  <p>In the event of an emergency, your medical information may be used to:
  <ul>
      <li>Render first aid</li>
      <li>Notify an emergency contact</li>
      <li>Describe a missing trip's cars to search-and-rescue teams</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<div class="well" id="who-can-view-my-information">
  <h4>Who can view my information?</h4>

  <p>Only trip leaders can see your medical information. <strong>No other participants can see your medical information.</strong></p>
