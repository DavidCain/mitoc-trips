<div class="well" id="rationale">
  <h4>Why are there guidelines on trip difficulty?</h4>
  <p>
    To help standardize difficulty ratings, we've created a set of guidelines
    to help leaders advertise their trips. This system also helps participants
    understand what they are signing up for in a trip.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consistent difficulty ratings allow participants to elect trips which
    challenge them appropriately and help them grow. For leaders, consistent
    ratings help attract participants who are well-suited to attend trips.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="distinct-from-ratings">
  <h4>Does this replace the WSC determining A/B/C trips?</h4>
  <p>
    No. The Winter Safety Committee is still in charge of determining what
    leader rating is appropriate for each trip. Leaders should still provide
    the rating they believe is appropriate for their trip. However, the WSC is
    ultimately responsible for approving all trips as well as ensuring that
    leader-supplied ratings fit the described trip.
  </p>
  <p>
    A trip's difficultly rating is completely separate from the
    <a href="{% url 'help-ws_ratings' %}">official trip rating system</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="formality">
  <h4>Are these suggested ratings a formal requirement?</h4>
  <p>
    This classification system is a suggestion; there is no formal process to
    ensure that leaders use these ratings. Leaders that deviate from these
    guidelines should explain their rationale to participants. Suggestions on
    how to improve these guidelines are always welcome!
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="special-circumstances">
  <h4>What about trips in between two categories? Overnights, bushwhacking, x-mode trips, etc.?</h4>
  <p>
    "Be a grump - bump it up!"
  </p>
  <p>
    These guidelines provide a baseline for difficulty. Additional factors
    should factor into <em>increasing</em> the difficulty rating. For instance,
    a difficult trail on an otherwise moderate mountain should be regarded as a
    difficult trip. Leaders should generally bump up the trip difficulty once
    for each "special sauce" on the trip.
  </p>

    <strong>Examples:</strong>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Garfield is a difficult trip from criteria including its long approach.
        Lugging overnight gear to the summit makes the trip advanced.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lonesome Lake Hut would be an easy trip, since it is a day hike.
        Lugging overnight gear to the hut makes it moderate.
        Bushwhacking to the hut first would make the trip difficult.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hale is a difficult hike due to the long approach in the winter.
        Cross-country skiing the 2.5 mile road walk would make the trip
        advanced, since participants must know how to ski and hike.
      </li>
    </ul>
