<h2>Signing Up for Trips</h2>
<div class="well" id="go_on_trips">
  <h4>What do I need to do to go on trips?</h4>
  <p>You must have up-to-date personal information to attend any trip. To attend Winter School trips, you must have attended both lectures. Certain trips may have other prerequisites - when in doubt, check with the leaders! </p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="how_to_sign_up">
  <h4>How do I sign up for a trip?</h4>
  <p>Signups for each trip open at a time given in the &quot;sign up&quot; section of the trip summary.</p>
  <p>When signups open, you can sign up with the form that appears below the trip summary. If the trip is a lottery trip, you'll later find out if you were placed. You'll find out immediately if the trip is first-come, first-serve.</p>
  <p>You may only sign up once.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="how_to_delete">
  <h4>How do I remove myself from a trip?</h4>
  <p>If you expressed interest in a lottery trip, but the lottery hasn't run, you can
  visit the <a href="{% url 'lottery_preferences' %}#ranked_trips">lottery preferences</a>
  page. Simply tick "delete" on any trip you no longer wish to attend.</p>

  <p>Some trips may allow you to remove yourself by clicking the "drop off trip" button.
  Otherwise, email your leaders and asked to be removed.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="on_trip">
  <h4>How do I know if I'm on the trip?</h4>
  <p>If the trip was a first-come, first-serve trip, you will immediately be able to see if you made the participant list, or have been placed in the waiting list. If the trip is a lottery trip, you will know once the lottery algorithm has run. For more information, see the <a href="{% url 'help-lottery' %}">lottery help pages</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="timezone">
  <h4>What timezone are trip times in?</h4>
  <p>All times are in Eastern Daylight Time.</p>
</div>
