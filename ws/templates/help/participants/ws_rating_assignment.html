    <h4>Rating Upgrades</h4>

    <p>
      Leader upgrades work on a reference system. If you are planning on
      requesting a recommendation for an upgrade, you should let your
      co-leaders know while planning your trip. You should try to handle as
      much of the organization of the trip as possible and demonstrate
      leadership during the trip itself.
