  <h2>How Leader Ratings are Assigned</h2>
  <div class="well" id="terrain_rating_assignment">
    <h4>Initial Terrain Ratings: (co)A, (co)B, (co)C</h4>

    <p>
      To receive a Winter School leader rating you should have some winter hiking
      experience, and some group management experience (could be leading summer
      hikes).
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a new Winter School leader you start with only a co-rating to
      learn how MITOC does things from an established full leader. If you have
      substantial winter hiking experience outside of MITOC we will ask you to
      have your co-leader the first weekend send a reference for upgrade to full
      leader status once you are familiar with the MITOC way of doing things.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a coB rating you should have experience travelling in B terrain. Most
      trips are B trips so we try to assign coB ratings where possible, and
      most winter hiking experience falls within B territory anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a coC rating you should know how to self-arrest from all 4 positions,
      proper ice axe and crampon use, be able to navigate in poor visibility, and
      properly layer above treeline.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not have current WFA (or higher) you cannot be a full B or C leader.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div class="well" id="activity_rating_assignment">
    <h4>Initial Activity Ratings: (co)I, (co)S</h4>

    <p>
      coI leaders are likely experienced rock climbers, good at building TR
      anchors, and have experience following ice. Most often they are MITOC rock
      climbing leaders or involved in the rock climbing program. Full Ice leaders
      are required to be comfortable leading WI3 as we expect full ice leaders to
      know how to read ice conditions and have substantial ice climbing
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      coS leaders are generally experienced frontcountry skiers (blacks aren’t
      hard) with at least some backcountry ski experience. Full S leaders have
      critical hard skills that include knowing how to identify what is and is
      not avalanche terrain (and knowing to stay out of it for MITOC trips),
      proper setup, fit and basic repair of AT and telemark gear, and use of
      skins/ other backcountry ski gear.
    </p>

  <div class="well" id="upgrades">
    <h4>Rating Upgrades</h4>

    <p>
      Upgrades work on a reference system. If you are planning on requesting a
      recommendation for an upgrade, you should let your co-leaders know while
      planning your trip. You should try to handle as much of the organization of
      the trip as possible and be sure to lead the group at times while in the
      wilderness to demonstrate your ability!
    </p>

    <p>
      To move from coB to B or coC to C you should be leading that level trip,
      emailing the WSC to let us know you want to upgrade, and having your
      co-leaders emailing the WSC references shortly after your trip is finished.
      We typically ask for two favorable references (from two different trips)
      for an upgrade. We are looking for good group management and decision
      making, a clear understanding of MITOC rules, and the ability to organize a
      successful trip!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a coB rated leader who wants a coC rating you should
      participate as a participant on a C trip and ask your leaders for
      references. We are looking to see that you are familiar with the issues of
      above treeline travel, are able to take care of yourself, and have
      experience using traction.
    </p>
