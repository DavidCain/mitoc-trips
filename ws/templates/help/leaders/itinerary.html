<h2>Itinerary, Planning, &amp; WIMP</h2>
<div class="well" id="who">
  <h4>Who is the WIMP?</h4>
  <p>
    The Worry If Missing Person (WIMP) is a MITOC member who graciously
    volunteers to stay in the front country for the weekend and be our contact
    person to make sure everybody makes it out safely. If you miss your
    deadline contacting the WIMP, they assume you are in trouble and call
    rescue personnel with your trip plan. They also have emergency contacts for
    each person on your trip.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="procedures">
  <h4>What are the WIMP procedures?</h4>
  <p>
    Before leading a trip, trip leaders need to provide the WIMP with a
    detailed trip plan through the Trip Itinerary page.
    <strong>No trip shall occur without an itinerary first being submitted</strong>.

    The Trip Itinerary page will become available a few days before the
    trip (Thursday nights for weekend trips), and is editable through the day
    of the trip. Leaders must also make sure that trip participants on the
    signup page match the participants actually attending your trip. If your
    trip plan changes before you start your trip, be sure to update your
    itinerary so the WIMP has the most up-to-date information.
  </p>
  <p>
    During your trip, tell your students about the WIMP procedures, and ask
    them to remind you to call the WIMP once you return to the trailhead.
  </p>
  <p>
    After your trip returns to the trailhead, contact the WIMP as soon as
    possible. Not after dinner or back at Camelot, but as soon as you have
    reception. The WIMP can be contacted at
    <a href="mailto:wimp@mit.edu">wimp@mit.edu</a>, or by the preferred
    contact information they will email out before the weekend. If you cannot
    reach the WIMP, be sure to leave a message. It also doesn't hurt to try
    back later. If your trip has an emergency, let the WIMP know after
    contacting emergency services.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="info">
  <h4>What information needs to be in a trip itinerary?</h4>
  <p>
    The itinerary provides the WIMP with information they may need to help
    coordinate search and rescue attempts should they be necessary, and must
    include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The actual drivers for your trip</li>
    <li>A detailed schedule for your trip from trailhead to trailhead that includes trail names and intersections as well as a turnaround time</li>
    <li>A worry time. The worry time should be 2 hours past your expected return time to the trailhead.</li>
  </ul>

        We'll be starting our trip at the Cog Railway Base Station, departing
        on the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail. We'll hike to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut (3.1 miles, 2500 ft).
        There, we will assess the above-treeline conditions and, if favorable,
        take Crawford Path towards the Mt. Washington Summit. We aim to summit by 1 pm,
        and will turn around if we don't summit by then. We should finish our trip at 4:30 pm,
        with cell service and the ability to call the WIMP.
