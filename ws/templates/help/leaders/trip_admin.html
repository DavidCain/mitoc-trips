  <h4>What is the trip admin view?</h4>
  <p>The trip administration view is similar to the trip-viewing page that
  everyone else sees, but it includes some features available only to the
  trip's creator and the leaders on the trip. Key features include the ability
  to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Edit trip details</li>
    <li>Modify the participant list</li>
    <li>View trip medical information</li>
    <li>Submit trip itinerary to the WIMP</li>
    <li>Give participant feedback</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To explore the trip admin interface, you can navigate to your trip's
  viewing page (e.g. through <a href="{% url 'view_trips' %}">upcoming trips</a>).
  You'll be automatically redirected to the trip administration page.
  You can also go directly to trip administration by viewing
  <a href="{% url 'profile' %}">trips you're leading</a>.</p>

<div class="well" id="before_trip">
  <h4>What do I need to do before leaving on my trip?</h4>
  <p>
  <small><em>Disclaimer:</em> These are the steps that need to take place on the web
    site. This does not include standard pre-trip procedures.
  </small>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ensure that the participant list is accurate: remove anyone who's not
      on your trip, and <a href="#leader_added">manually add</a> anyone who
      doesn't appear on the participant roster.
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that all participant (and leader) information is accurate.</li>
    <li>Submit your <a href="#trip_itinerary">trip itinerary</a> to the WIMP.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well" id="before_trip">
  <h4>What do I need to do after my trip?</h4>
  <p><a href="{% url 'help-feedback' %}">Leave feedback!</a></p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="trip_medical">
  <h4>How do I view everyone's contact or medical information?</h4>
  <p>You can always click on a participant's name for a detailed summary of their information.
  However, if you'd like to see a summary of everyone on your trip (leaders
  included), click on "show WIMP info." The linked page will include medical
  information and contact information for each person on your trip.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="trip_itinerary">
  <h4>What do I put in the trip itinerary?</h4>
  <p>Your trip itinerary should contain everything that a rescue party would
  want to know. It should contain at minimum which cars are driving for your
  trip, a complete list of participants, and accurate medical information for
  everyone. It should also contain a detailed description of your group's
  intentions. Your plans may change, so you are encouraged to update your
  itinerary as often as needed to ensure it's up-to-date. The WIMP will always
  have access to the most recent trip itinerary.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="signups">
  <h4>How do signups work?</h4>
  <p>A "signup" denotes that a participant has shown interest in your trip.
  When your trip is in lottery mode, participants can freely sign up without
  being placed on your trip or its wait list. The lottery algorithm will later
  decide if they should be placed on your trip (for more information, see
  the <a href="{% url 'help-lottery' %}">lottery help pages</a>).</p>

  <p>When your trip is in "first-come, first-serve" mode, any participants
  signing up will immediately be placed on your trip or on the next available
  spot on the waiting list.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="waitlist">
  <h4>How does the waitlist work?</h4>
  <p>The waitlist is an ordered queue of participant signups. Whenever a spot
  opens up on your trip, the first signup from the queue is automatically added
  to your trip. When a participant is placed on a trip, he or she receives an
  email urging them to contact that trip's leaders.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="priority">
  <h4>How is the waitlist ordered?</h4>
  <p>Normally, when a signup is added to the waitlist, that signup goes to
  the bottom. However, under certain circumstances, the signup can be added
  towards the top. For example, if a participant
  <a href="{% url 'help-lottery' %}#driver_priority">loses their trip spot to a driver</a>,
  they will go to the top of the list. Additionally, leaders can add participants
  directly to the trip. If the trip is full, leader-added participants will be placed
  towards to the top of the waiting list.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="leader_added">
  <h4>How do leader-added signups work?</h4>
  <p>Normally, participants will sign themselves up for a trip. However, under
  certain circumstances, a leader may want to sign up participants. For example,
  a participant may be a last-minute addition, and the leader wants to ensure
  that the participant list is accurate for the WIMP form. Alternatively,
  a given participant may be needed so that the trip has enough drivers. The
  leader can add this participant (or bump an existing signup) so that he or she
  bypasses the waiting list queue.</p>

  <p>When using the manual participant signup form, participants are normally
  placed above existing waitlist signups, but below other prioritized signups
  (such as participants who were bumped due to lack of drivers). Leaders can
  optionally override this behavior so that the signup in question goes to
  the absolute first position in the waitlist.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="trip_creation">
  <h4>Can I create a trip where I'm not a leader?</h4>
  <p>Yes. You can create trips for other leaders and retain the ability
  to administer that trip.</p>
</div>
