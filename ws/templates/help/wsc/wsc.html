<div class="well" id="trip_approval">
  <h4>How does does the WSC approve trips?</h4>
  <p>To mark a trip as approved, use the <a href="{% url 'manage_trips' 'winter_school' %}">trip management interface</a>. Simply tick each
  trip as approved, and click submit.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="trip_approval">
  <h4>How do trips lose approval?</h4>
  <p>If trip leaders edit the trip itself, they will lose its approval. Leaders are
  given a warning about this behavior if their trip is already approved.</p>

  <p>
  Previously approved trips lose their approval when:
  <ul>
    <li>A trip leader edits any field of the trip. This includes the leader list, trip date, description, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  Trips do <em>not</em> lose approval if:
  <ul>
    <li>An admin or WSC member edits the trip</li>
    <li>Leaders submit or modify trip itinerary</li>
    <li>The participant list changes for any reason</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<div class="well" id="lecture_attendance">
  <h4>How do we record lecture attendance?</h4>
  <p>In the <a href="{% url 'ws_settings' %}">Winter School settings</a>, you
  can let participants mark themselves as having attended lectures. It's recommended
  that you only do this during lectures. Participants can then sign on with their mobile
  devices or laptops, and mark themselves as having attended.
  </p>
  <p>As the Winter School chair, you can also manually mark a participant as having
  attended lectures. (Recall that you can
  <a href="{% url 'participant_lookup' %}">look up any participant</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="wimp">
  <h4>How is the WIMP specified?</h4>
  <p> A comprehensive <a href="{% url 'all_trips_medical' %}">sheet for the WIMP</a> is
  available at any time. It lists all the emergency information for all upcoming
  trips. This page is viewable only to members of the WSC and designated WIMPs.
  To specify a WIMP for a given week, have an admin add the participant to the
  WIMP group.</p>
