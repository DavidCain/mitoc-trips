    Before departing on your trip, it's imperative that one of the leaders
    complete the following form. The responses you give here are very important -
    they are automatically relayed to the WIMP, and will be used to coordinate
    any search and rescue efforts.

    <strong>Important:</strong> If you make any changes to your trip itinerary,
    you should return to this page and update the appropriate fields. This will ensure
    that the WIMP has the most up-to-date information regarding your trip.
