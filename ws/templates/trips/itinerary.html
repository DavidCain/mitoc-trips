    Before departing on your trip, it's imperative that one of the leaders
    complete the following form. The responses you give here are very important -
    they are automatically relayed to the WIMP, and will be used to coordinate
    any search and rescue efforts.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> If you make any changes to your trip itinerary,
    you should return to this page and update the appropriate fields. This will ensure
    that the WIMP has the most up-to-date information regarding your trip.

<h2>WIMP information submission</h2>

      This form will become available at

    <p>
      Why not sooner? It's critical that the submitted itinerary match the most up-to-date plan.
      Any number of circumstances can cause you to change a trip's itinerary (a new weather
      forecast, participants dropping off the trip, drivers shuffling about, etc.)
      Requiring itinerary submission shortly before a trip increases the likelihood
      of having accurate information to relay to emergency contacts and rescuers.
