<h4>Leader/Trip Rating Definitions</h4>
<p>
    Winter School leaders are assigned a terrain rating and an optional activity rating.
    Leaders can be assigned full or co-ratings.
    Full leaders are expected to mentor co-leaders and take responsibility for risk management decisions.
</p>

<h5>Ratings by Terrain</h5>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A</strong>: below treeline, within 1 hour of intensive care</li>
  <li><strong>B</strong>: anything below treeline more than one hour from intensive care</li>
  <li><strong>C</strong>: above treeline</li>
</ul>

<h5>Ratings by Activity</h5>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I</strong>: single-pitch ice climbing</li>
  <li><strong>I+</strong>: multi-pitch ice climbing</li>
  <li><strong>S</strong>: backcountry skiing (not required for cross-country skiing)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Activity ratings are secondary to terrain ratings: a {B, S} leader can only
  lead ski mountaineering trips below treeline. A leader rated {A, co-B, co-I}
  can act as primary leader on A-level trips, can co-lead B-level trips with a
  full B or C leader, and can co-lead ice climbing trips as long as they qualify
  as B level or below.
</p>
<p>
  Note that coS leaders can lead <strong>uphill ski</strong> trips within
  resort boundaries without a full S co-leader. Additionally, all A, B, or C
  leaders can lead <strong>downhill resort</strong> ski trips without an S or
  co-S rating.
