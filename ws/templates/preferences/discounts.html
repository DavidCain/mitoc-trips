<h1>MITOC Discounts</h1>
<h2>Local Discounts (Discontinued)</h2>
<p class="lead">
  Previously, MITOC allowed automatic sharing of information with local businesses.
</p>
<p>
  The discount program has been discontinued. Local businesses may extend
  discounts (at their own discretion) to MITOCers. Inquire directly at those
  businesses; MITOC does not manage these programs in any way.

        MITOC student members can get discounted passes:
        $889 for the Ikon Pass,
        and $569 for the Ikon Base Pass.
    </p>
    <p>
        The major distinction between the Ikon (Full) and Base passes are that the
        Base passes have some blackout dates, and provide 5 days vs. 7 days at
        the non-core resorts.

        In the Northeast, locations include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stratton, VT (unlimited)</li>
        <li>Sugarbush, VT (unlimited)</li>
        <li>Tremblant, QC (unlimited)</li>
        <li>Killington-Pico, VT</li>
        <li>Sugarloaf, ME</li>
        <li>Sunday River, ME</li>
        <li>Loon, NH</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Discounts can be requested now and used later; the program
      closes November 30, 2025, so make sure to purchase before then.
      Note that prices are expected to increase mid-spring and mid-fall;
      the exact dates of the price increases are unknown.
