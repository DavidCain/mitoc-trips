<h3>Notes about the Export</h3>
<p>
  <h4>Feedback</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Missing comments:</strong>
      This dump might show feedback that trip leaders have given about you. To
      keep feedback confidential, leaders' comments are not shown.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Old feedback:</strong>
      If you're a trip leader, we show a complete history of participant
      feedback that you've supplied. Note that all feedback is hidden from the
      system after 13 months. If you have feedback that's older than 13 months,
      nobody but you and the activity chairs can see it.
      <small>(note that during Winter School 2022, we've temporarily increased
      the 13-month feedback window to be 25 months)</small>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Timestamps</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Confusing timestamps:</strong>
      Some entries may have timestamps that don't make sense.
      For instance, your attendance at 2016's Winter School lectures might have been created in January of 2017.
      In these cases, the record was created (or timestamped) after the actual event occurred.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Time zones:</strong>
      All timestamps are in UTC, not Eastern Standard Time.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
