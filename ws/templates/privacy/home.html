    </p>
    <p>
      We will occasionally share your name, email address, and car description with
      other participants for trip-planning purposes. Your name and email address
      are displayed ubiquitously throughout the system, but never on a
      public-facing page. Your cell phone number is visible to trip leaders.
    </p>
    <p>In the event of an emergency, your medical information may be used to:
      <ul>
        <li>Render first aid</li>
        <li>Notify an emergency contact</li>
        <li>Describe a missing trip's cars to search-and-rescue teams</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      We are required to share your name, email address, and cell phone number with
      <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/sole">Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement</a>
      for official club trips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only trip leaders can see your medical information. No other participants can see your medical information.
