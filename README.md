# About
This is a Django-based trip management system for the [MIT Outing Club][mitoc].

biking, skiing, mountaineering, rafting, canoeing, and surfing. All trips are
open to MITOC members - a community of thousands.


# Deployment
It takes a single command and a few minutes to deploy this software.
Clone the [mitoc-ansible][mitoc-ansible] repository and follow the instructions

# [History][about]
This site was created in 2014 to improve MITOC's Winter School program. It has
since evolved into the central portal for all MITOC trips.

Once upon a time, Winter School trips operated on a first-come, first-serve
basis. Signups opened at noon, and filled up extremely quickly. Many
participants found themselves unable to attend any trips in a given weekend,
and others struggled to gain exposure to new activities.

We introduced a lottery system to combat the "fastest gun in the West" problem.
Instead of rewarding trip slots to whomever could sign up the fastest, we used
an equitable algorithm to distribute trip slots. As a result of this new
algorithm, we saw unprecedented levels of participation. Everyone who expressed
interest in attending weekend trips was placed on a trip, and popular
activities like ice climbing were more accessible.

Today, all MITOC trips are organized through this portal. Many trips are
first-come, first-serve, but we use lottery-based signups for other popular
trip formats once subject to same problems as Winter School.
